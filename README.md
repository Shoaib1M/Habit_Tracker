# ðŸ“Š Habit Tracker API Project

This project is part of Day 37 of the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. It demonstrates how to interact with external APIs using HTTP POST requests, with a focus on building a basic habit tracker that logs activities using the [Pixela API](https://pixe.la/).

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Learn

- How HTTP POST requests work in Python
- How to send and receive JSON data using the `requests` library
- Authenticating with APIs using HTTP headers
- How to use Pythonâ€™s `datetime` module for autofilling dates
- How to use APIs to update a habit-tracking graph

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] Day 37 Goals overview
- [x] Sending HTTP POST Requests
- [x] Advanced Authentication using API keys and headers
- [x] Adding a pixel (habit entry) to the tracker
- [x] Using `strftime` to autofill todayâ€™s date

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
